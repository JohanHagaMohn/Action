# Action
A unique to-do application as a final project for CS50.


This is a prototype application written as a final project for EdX's CS50. It is written in python using the flask framework in tandem with a PostgreSQL database. While the primary purpose of the project was to develop back-end skills, the design and javascript animations are what ultimately ended up taking the longest time.
